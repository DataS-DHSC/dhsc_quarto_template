## Guidance

**To do:**

-   Update the details at the top of the page for your presentation.

-   Create your powerpoint by choosing the types of slides you require and replacing the placeholder text with your contents.

-   To render the powerpoint, save this file and press render.

**Tips:**

-   Slides are defined with a level 2 heading (##).

-   To add bullet points, use a hyphen followed by 2 spaces then the text, and a blank line between each bullet point.

-   [Information about slide types](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/powerpoint.html#slide-layouts).

-   Once rendered and in PowerPoint you can make further changes if required.


## Guidance continued

To add R code or an R output (see options on the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html#overview)).

To combine text with code outputs outputs, the code chunk options need to be 'results: asis' and the text needs to be within the cat() function.

```{r}
#| results: asis
cat(paste0("For example, there are ", nrow(mtcars), " cars in the mtcars dataset."))
```
